      <h3>Get to Know Me</h3>
      <article>
        <p class="introduction-title">About</p>
        <p>I'm from Conifer, Colorado. It's a small secluded mountain town, but filled with wonderful childhood memories. It was at the ripe age of three that sports were introduced to me. I started my athletic career as a ballerina, but I quickly became bored with that. To boost my adrenaline rush I switched to gymnastics. After several years in this sport and a broken foot it was time to transition to a sport that wasn't as demanding on your body. In 5th grade I joined a basketball team and continued to play the sport throughout high school. Additionally, I picked up tennis on the side and to this day play on a USTA league. From this history, you can see that sports have been a large part of my life.</p>

        <p class="introduction-title">Education/Experience</p>
        <p> I went to Arizona State University. I graduated with a B.S. in Marketing and an International Business Certificate. Right after I graduated I wanted to explore the world by teaching abroad. I taught English to children, college students, and adults in South Korea for two years. After coming back from Korea I was in the oil and gas industry for a couple of years as an Engineering Technician specialized in ARIES. With the downturn in oil price I wanted to switch gears and find a career that I was actually passionate about. I was seeking something challenging yet creative and that's when I discovered the Front-End Engineering Program at <a href="https://www.turing.io/" target="_blank">Turing School of Software &amp; Design.</a></p>

        <p class="introduction-title">Hobbies</p>
        <p>I'm an adventurer at heart. After living abroad my perspective changed on life and I gained a passion for traveling. I love immersing myself in another culture and embracing the richness and uniqueness each culture has to offer. Since I'm from Colorado the outdoors are my second home. Hiking, skiing, fishing and biking are all activities that you'll find me doing. As of recently, I bought a Kawasaki motorcycle. Riding really puts you out in nature exposed to all the elements and I absolutely love that feeling. When I'm not being active outdoors I enjoy reading and spending time with my friends. My closest friends are from elementary school and I owe that to growing-up in such a small town.</p>
